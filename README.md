# musicplayerui

This was a React Assessment I took on "CodeSignal" as part of a candidate screening. The UI was already in place, I just needed to write the functionality to make the "box" around the song go back and forth based on whatever button was being pushed. I had 30 minutes to do this and, unfortunately, no access to console.log(). I ended up not completing it within the 30 minutes. I was able to do it here, start to finish, in just under an hour.
